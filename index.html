                <h2>How much does the proliferation of Electric Vehicles <br>effect our environment?</h2>
                <p>The ever-increasing concern about climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as a cleaner alternative to traditional combustion engine vehicles. However, there are growing debate on the actual environmental impact of EVs, regarding their manufacturing and battery production, and the production of electricity. While EVs emit no pollutants during operation, the production and disposal of EV batteries raise questions about their overall environmental sustainability. <br><br>For this project, team Pewter aims to critically evaluate the extent to which EVs reduce carbon emissions and investigate the environmental impact of their manufacturing process and the production of electricity.</p>
